## Intent

Instigate the candidate to solve a challenge in a while determined, in order to identify categories and technical weaknesses for better internal targeting and onboarding according to the practices and technologies used in the Brainny Smart Solutions.

## Project

The development proposal consists of the implementation of a system for the management of clock-in records of the employees of a company.

### Abstract

### Functional Requirements

- **[FR01]** - Manage time records
- **[FR02]** - Record the collaborator's arrival and departure times
- **[FR03]** - The user with administrator permissions will be able to view in real time the records of collaborators, without need to refresh the page

### Non-functional Requirements

- **[NFR01]** - Only collaborators can record the point
- **[NFR02]** - Only the administrator can view the list with collaborators's records;
- **[NFR03]** - The system will use authentication with JWT
- **[NFR04]** - Node API development;
- **[NFR05]** - Web Client development in React.
